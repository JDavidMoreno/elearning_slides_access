There are a few things to improve here:

- Next button at the end of a Test completion should exists, and should decide whether to show Next or Close depending if
 next slide is accessible or not. For the moment it just shows always 'Close'

 - Continue button at the end of test in not-fullscreen mode should follow a similar logic as below

 - Set Done in not full screen also should follow the same logic


 And I think, this is all ...
